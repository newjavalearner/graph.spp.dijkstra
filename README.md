# Introduction

This project is a simple implementation of the Dijkstra algorithm for finding the shortest path. 

After checking the internet, it really disappoints me that multiple shortest path problem is not considered in most codes. So I have modified the algorithm a bit, enabling it to find shortest paths with the same distance. 

As a new learner of Java, I welcome your suggestions and contributions to this project.
